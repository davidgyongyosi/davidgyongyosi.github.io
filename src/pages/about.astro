          I'm a graduated full-stack software engineer based in Hungary. I can develop responsive
          websites from scratch and raise them into modern user-friendly web experiences.
          Alongside that, I am able to create a full-stack application with the latest technologies and frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a passion for creating websites and apps. I love to learn new technologies and frameworks,
          and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills.
        </p>
